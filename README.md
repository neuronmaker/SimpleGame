## How To Play

Start the game by moving the player in any direction, steer the player towards pellets and eat them before they vanish. Eating pellets spawns new pellets and keeps the game going. Eat fast!

There is no time limit, the game is over when all the pellets are gone.

Score higher by eating pellets as fast as possible, the more you eat, the longer you can play and the higher the score you can earn.
